# Amazon SSP Barcode Generator Tool [2023]
During my time at Amazon (2022-2023), I developed this Tampermonkey script to improve package scanning efficiency within the **SSP**. The tool allows employees to instantly generate scannable barcodes based on selected text, eliminating manual entry and reducing errors.

## ðŸš€ Measurable Impact
Teams using this tool worked 5x faster compared to those without it, directly contributing to higher throughput and improved on-time performance. By automating barcode generation, the tool streamlined workflows for **Problem Solvers** and **Team Leads**, saving valuable time in daily operations.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
+ **Instant Barcode Generation:** Automatically creates barcodes for pallet IDs and other logistics markers.
+ **Efficient Integration:** Simple tooltip interface with no need for extensive training.
+ **Optimized for SSP:** Designed and tested for Amazon's internal systems.



This project showcases my ability to solve real-world operational challenges by developing scalable, impactful solutions.
